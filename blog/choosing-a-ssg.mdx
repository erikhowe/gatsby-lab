Being able to choose the appropriate tool is an imporant skill for developers; and since no tool is perfect, a developer has to analyze the benefits and drawbacks of her options before she makes a decision. When it was time for me to decide which static site generator to use for my professional website and developer blog, ease of use was the most important quality to me. The approach I decided to use to help me decide which SSG I wanted to work with was something you might be familiar with because you did it during undergrad: labs. For each SSG, I went through the quickstart guides they provided and based my decision off of my experience doing that.

Jekyll seemed like a good choice, but after discovering that it doesn't play well with Ruby 3 and that Github was wavering on whether or not to maintain it, I decided that it wasn't dependable and might result in more work down the line. Hugo was my next option and not only was it incredibly fast, but easy to set up. A few commands on the command line and some configuration with the theme results in a seemingly polished static site with most if not all the features I wanted for a personal developer site. However, I didn't want to familiarize myself with Go Templates and I didn't want to be beholden to a template and it's creator for features that I might've wanted. That really left Gatsby and Next which are both React frameworks that are slightly opinionated and have some neat optimization and seo features built in. The predominating opinion seems to be that Gatsby is great for static sites and plays nicely with headless CMS's like Netlify to create a really straightforward workflow for adding blog posts, while Next is suited for SPA's that require scaling optimizations because it exclusively runs on a Node server. Both frameworks are consistently updated and maintained, are easy to set up quickly, use React components (which I'm familiar with) and have very good build and response times (both perform better than Hugo on some benchmarks, but who really knows). If you're already familiar with React, I recommend that you go through the quickstart tutorials for both frameworks and see which one works for you, however if you're new to React then I'd suggest going with Hugo.
